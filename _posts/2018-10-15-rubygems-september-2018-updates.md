Welcome to the RubyGems monthly update! As part of our efforts at [Ruby Together](http://rubytogether.org), we publish a recap of the work that we've done the previous month. Read on to find out what updates were made to RubyGems and RubyGems.org in September.

## rubygems.org news

This month, we updated seven dependencies on rubygems.org and simplified and sped up some rack-attack integration tests with the help of [@mjankowski](https://github.com/mjankowski). We also discovered that it was possible to create "hidden" gems that would not show up in gem lists, and [@kerrizor](https://github.com/kerrizor) implemented a fix. Overall, rubygems.org got 15 commits from 2 authors making 146 additions and 263 deletions across 8 files.

## rubygems news

This month, RubyGems merged 12 pull requests, including downloading multiple gems in parallel during install, setting up a new mergebot, and adding a `--resign` flag to the cert command. There were 26 new commits, contributed by 6 authors, with 251 additions and 163 deletions across 28 files.
