title: Rubyconf / Rubygems Hackfest

If you followed the twitter feed for Rubyconf this past week, you
probably noticed that this years conference was the host of the first, of
hopefully many more, Rubygems.org hackfests.  The hackfest started at
6:30 PM, after Matz's chat with Evan wrapped up, and went until almost
11:00 PM, when we had scheduled to wrap up around 8:30.

I am personally blown away by the amazing turnout we had, and especially
floored that in addition to commenting and closing many issues which
were no longer valid, almost every single attendee of the hackfest
opened a pull request to fix either an outstanding bug, or add a new
feature.

Some photos from the event:

I'm still in the process of working through the open pull requests and
issues which need further commenting, but I wanted to provide some of
the highlights, and welcome some of the soon-to-be Rubygems.org committers.

Please let me know if I missed you, or something you worked on in the list.
It was amazing to see developers of all kinds, from companies such
as Yardstick, New Relic and Bluebox step up to assist in helping build
and maintain a community resource.
